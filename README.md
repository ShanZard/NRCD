We propose a novel remote sensing change detection task, non-registration change detection, to address the increasing number of emergencies such as natural disasters, anthropogenic accidents, and military strikes. Refer to our paper for more details.  

We will update the code and dataset as soon as possible. Please stay tuned!!!
